Creating a branch

By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. 
You can create additional branches off of main in your repository. **You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.**
- This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code.
- The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. 
- You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could *pull* in those updates.

This diagram shows:

* The main branch
* A new branch called feature
* The journey that feature takes before it's merged into main
